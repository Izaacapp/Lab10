# Lab Assignment 10 - Trie Data Structure
## Project Description
This project implements a trie data structure to efficiently count the number of occurrences of each word from a dictionary. The trie allows for fast insertion and search. The program reads words from a file and uses the trie to count occurrences, which can be queried through the command line.
